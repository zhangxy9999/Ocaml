Archiv Produktion is a subsidiary label of Deutsche Grammophon founded in 1948.[1]
The first head of Archiv Produktion, serving in the position from 1948 to 1957, was Fred Hamel, a musicologist who set out the early Archiv Produktion releases according to 12 research periods, from Gregorian Chant to Mannheim and Vienna.[2] Hamel's successor 1958-1968 Hans Hickmann was a professor at the University of Hamburg who focused on Bach and Handel.[3] The next director was Andreas Holschneider (b. 1931) from 1970-1991. In December 1991 Holschneider gave an interview to Gramophone where he defended the entry of Archiv Produktion and authentic instrument specialists such as John Eliot Gardiner into Romantic territory of Schumann and Berlioz.[4] The label's next head was Peter Czornyj (b. 1956) from 1992.[5]
In parallel the Decca Group also acquired in 1970 the rights the recording catalogue of the French-Australian music publishers Ã‰ditions de l'Oiseau-Lyre and began to issue early music recordings using the l'Oiseau-Lyre brand.
