Beatriz Enríquez de Arana (1467–1536) was the mistress of Christopher Columbus.
Beatriz was born in the small village of Santa Maria of Trassierra (near Cordoba) in a family of peasant farmers and small share holders.[7] She was from a noble family of Cordoba, Spain.[8][9][10] She had two brothers.[11][12]
According to historian Rafael Ramírez de Arellano, her father or stepfather was Pedro de Torquemada of converso origin and her mother was Ana Núñez de Arana. In his history of Cordoba he explains that she and her brother Peter took the name of their maternal aunt Mayor Enríquez de Arana. She was one of the relatives who took them in (with possibly Francisco Enriquez de Arana, a wine maker) when they became orphaned in 1471. The Núñez de Arana families were small landholders of modest means. Beatriz knew how to read and write, an unusual thing at the time. This indicated she had at least some social status. Most historians agreed, though, that the lower social status of Beatriz is the reason why Columbus never married her. He had aspired to come across someone of higher social status to help benefit his ventures.[13][14][15]
