The Florida Small Business Development Center (FSBDC) is a non-profit organization serving small businesses in Florida. The FSBDC offers free information, training and consulting for entrepreneurs and small businesses. The FSBDC serves every county in Florida, with over 35 centers across the state.
The FSBDC was founded in 1976. The FSBDC was started at the University of West Florida as one of the eight original state-based Small Business Development Center pilots funded by the U.S. Small Business Administration. Other participating schools in the program were California State Polytechnic University at Pomona, California State University at Chico, The University of Georgia, University of Missouri, the University of Nebraska at Omaha, Rutgers University and the University of Southern Maine.[1] The schools were chosen based on their pre-existing efforts to further the business community in their areas.
The goal of these SBDC pilots was to link the state’s higher education system to community outreach, specifically to aid in the development and education of Florida's entrepreneurs and small business community. Today, the FSBDC is one of the 63 SBA funded SBDC programs. These SBDC programs are located in every state and US territory.[2]
The FSBDC began with two centers in its first year of operation. It has since grown to a statewide network of over 35 centers. These centers are partnered with universities, colleges, and other economic organizations. Additionally, they have over 60 outreach locations to provide entrepreneurial services on an as-needed basis in rural and outlying areas.
The FSBDC is state designated as Florida’s Principal Provider of Business Assistance and is the only statewide provider of entrepreneurial services in Florida.[3]
