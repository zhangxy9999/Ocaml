###Problem 2

1. legal. int 5

2. illegal. A float number multiply with integers 

3. illegal. A bool type expected after the if statement

4. illegal. "then" bound the return type to be int, so an int expected after "else"

5. illegal. y is unbounded

6. illegal. float type before the "in" and int type after the "in"

7. legal. (float -> float) * float 4.0

8. legal. int 7

9. legal string "cheezz"

10 illegal. y is a tuple int*string, x is a int, so cannot apply "y+x" at last
